\title{{\small Final Year Project Proposal:} \\ A Location Aware Reminder App for iOS}

\begin{abstract}
	Smartphones have become an every day essential item for most people, allowing them to access their data from virtually anywhere. More and more people use the phones to help them with tasks such as calendaring and setting reminders. I propose an idea for an app somewhere between these two things. Apple's iOS was recently updated to include a Reminders app that allows a reminder to be triggered from a specified location. My idea is to create an app that can trigger a reminder at a time, dependant on how far away the user is from their destination specifically targeting students.   
\end{abstract}

\section*{Description}
	In this project I wish to create an app for Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The app will be primarily aimed a students, but I hope to create a framework of sorts that can be easily used in other apps to allow for similar location aware reminders.
	The app will need to connect to a college's database server in order to download a students timetable. Once this has been done the student will be able to see their timetable on their device, as well as select which items they wish to receive location aware remminders for. The GPS in the students device will be used to check how far away from a lecture they are and remind them about their lecture a certain amount of time before, dependant on the students current location. For instance, if the student is 5 minutes away from their lectures. A reminder will be sent at least 5 minutes before the lecture time to tell the student they should head to lecture now.
