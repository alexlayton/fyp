For my final year project I'm going to be implementing an iOS app for location based reminders. The app will likely be universal for both iPhone and iPad, allowing the user to set reminders whether they are time based, location based or preemptive using both time and location. The reminders portion of the project will be built as a framework which can be used to build my final app. Here in the coming days, weeks and month I'm going to be documenting my findings and experiences while implementing my final year project.
